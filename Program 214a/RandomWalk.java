 *Program 214a - random walk program
 *
 *Description:Someone is standing at the center of a bridge that is 7 ft bridge long. Their stride is exactly one
 *            foot. They canâ€™t control the direction they are going but the bridge is very narrow and they can 
 *            only go forward or backward with each step. This program  calculates how many steps the 
 *            person will walk before exiting the bridge. This program executes this simulation 1000 times 
 *            and the output displays the average and greatest number of steps taken. 
 *What I learned: I learned how to use Monte carlo simulations and random number generators to perform caluclations
 *                that are otherwise very hard to perform. I also learned the importance of using logical steps in 
 *                programs to make sure numbers are kept well organzied and follow a certain logic.
 *Difficulties: I at first thought the program meant that the person was standing on one side and trying to get to the
 *              other, which yielded very high and improbably results, I then read the instructions again and 
 *              realized my mistakes.
