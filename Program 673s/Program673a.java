 * Astricks revised
 * 
 * Description:Earlier in the semester we wrote some programs that made triangles out of *â€™s.  
 *             So much of this project is already done for you.
 * What I learned: I learned how to use methods and call them.
 * Difficulties: SO MUCH CODE
 * 
 * 
 *!!!!! I did not give comments on the internal triangle programs becuase it was already done elsewhere!!!!
